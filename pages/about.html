        <h1>About Card Ref Pro</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Card Ref Pro</strong> started as a simple idea: give Trading Card Game (TCG) players a single, ultra-fast page to look up cards and rules without hunting through forums or slow databases. Over time it will grow into a full-featured toolbox for players, collectors, judges, and content creators.
        </p>

        <h2>Why this site exists</h2>
        <p>
            When a match or deck build depends on a single line of card text, seconds matter. Card Ref Pro prioritizes speed and clarity — compact card views, readable rulings, and keyboard-friendly search make it easy to find what you need in a hurry.
        </p>

        <h2>Core and Planned Features</h2>
        <p>The platform already supports fast card lookups and will include the following features as it grows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Card search</strong> — instant lookup by name, partial text, or card ID.</li>
            <li><strong>Card filtering</strong> — filter by set, rarity, type, cost, attack/defense and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Table view</strong> — customizable, sortable columns and column visibility to analyze lists of cards.</li>
            <li><strong>Deck building</strong> — create, edit, and test decks with an easy-to-use deck editor.</li>
            <li><strong>Deck exporting</strong> — export lists to common formats (CSV, plaintext) and shareable links.</li>
            <li><strong>TCGplayer integration</strong> — send deck lists for bulk purchasing to TCGplayer.</li>
            <li><strong>Random hand &amp; draw generator</strong> — simulate shuffles, draws, and opening hands.</li>
            <li><strong>More utilities</strong> — card comparison, banlist alerts, price lookups, and community requests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Current Coverage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong> — primary dataset and current focus.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <p>
            Next up: expand coverage to Pokémon TCG, Magic: The Gathering, One Piece, and other major games. Feature priorities will be guided by community feedback; early goals include a robust card filtering, table analytics, and deck building.
        </p>
